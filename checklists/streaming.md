# Streaming Go-Live Checklist

## Scheduling the session

* Send a meeting invite to the guest with a buffer of 30 min before going live for tech checks. Session is typically scheduled for an hour (and then the 30 min buffer prior).
* Ask the guest for the following -
  * Speaker Image
  * Speaker Bio
  * Any relevant social profiles they wish to share, e.g. LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, GitHub

## Prior to the session

* Update the Lower Thirds slides with the relevant information from the speaker
* Pull together a description for the episode
* Schedule the event on restream.io
* Scaffold the CloudWithChris.com site with YouTube URL

## Preparing for the call

* Launch OBS, PowerPoint (lower-thirds)
* Ensure that streamdeck is on the correct profile (Cloud with Chris Guest)
* Ensure NDI is turned on in Microsoft Teams
* Adjust the remote guest sources to be the correct video source from teams.
* Ensure that the Lower Thirds are visible over the appropriate scenes.
* Run through each scene in OBS, ensure that the guest can screenshare.
* Do an initial recording to check for any audio issues.
* Check that audio inputs are mapped to different channels, so that if there are audio issues, these can be edited out in post-production.

## Resetting after pre-flight checks

* Reset lower-thirds deck to initial slide
* Reset the intro loop background music to -40
* Give a 5 minute buffer before the go-live time

## Go-Live

* Start streaming 2 minutes before the go-live, on the holding page.
* Record AND stream the session when going live.
